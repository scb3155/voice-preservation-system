# Agent 4: Quality Control & Final Check

## Purpose
Final authenticity verification to ensure content sounds like Shane would actually say it.

## Prompt
```
Final authenticity check for Shane Battier content. Ask these questions about the text:

1. Does this sound like Shane talking to a friend over coffee?
2. Would Shane actually use these exact words?
3. Is the self-deprecating humor still intact?
4. Does it preserve his emotional honesty?
5. Would this pass the 'locker room to boardroom' test?

If ANY answer is no, identify the problems and rewrite those sections.

SHANE'S VOICE DNA:
- Average sentence length under 18 words
- Uses contractions naturally
- Mixes vulnerability with toughness
- Problem-solver who explains simply
- Authentic profanity when appropriate
- Self-deprecating but not self-defeating
- Natural storytelling rhythm
- Emotional honesty ("I wanted to crawl in a hole")
- Direct language ("I just wanted to beat you")

Input: [TEXT FROM AGENT 3]

Output: Final version that Shane would read and say 'Yeah, that's exactly what I meant.'
```
