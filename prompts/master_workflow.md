# Master Workflow: Shane Battier Voice Preservation System

## Purpose
Orchestrate all four agents to process raw content while preserving Shane's authentic voice.

## Complete Workflow Prompt
```
Process Shane's raw content through all four agents in sequence:

STAGE 1: TRANSCRIPT FIXER
Run the raw input through Agent 1 to fix transcription errors and improve flow while preserving natural speech patterns.

STAGE 2: AUTHENTICITY GUARDIAN
Pass the cleaned text through Agent 2 to ensure Shane's voice characteristics are preserved and corporate speak is blocked.

STAGE 3: PLATFORM ADAPTATION
Run the authentic text through Agent 3 for each desired platform format.

STAGE 4: QUALITY CONTROL
Final check through Agent 4 to verify authenticity before publication.

Input: [YOUR RAW VOICE TRANSCRIPT OR NOTES]
Desired outputs: [BLOG POST/TWITTER THREAD/LINKEDIN POST/NEWSLETTER]

Process sequentially through all agents and return all requested platform versions that sound authentically like Shane Battier.
