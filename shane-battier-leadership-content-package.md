Had this moment yesterday where I realized I've been overthinking leadership my whole career.

Was watching my daughter try to solve a math problem, getting frustrated, and I'm sitting there like I have any clue how to help. (Barely passed algebra myself.) She's getting worked up, eraser shavings everywhere, making that face kids make when they're about to give up. And honestly? I'm feeling pretty useless. Here's this kid looking to me for answers, and I've got nothing.

But then something interesting happened.

She just started talking through the problem out loud. Not to me, really. Just... thinking with her mouth. Working through each step, explaining what she was trying to do, where she was getting stuck. And suddenly, like magic, the answer became clear. To her. She figured it out herself.

Made me think - maybe the best leaders aren't the ones with all the answers, but the ones who create space for the answers to emerge.

**The Leadership Lie We All Believe**

Look, here's the thing about leadership that nobody wants to admit: most of us are faking it. We think we need to be the smartest person in the room, have all the solutions, never show weakness. (Classic imposter syndrome stuff.)

I spent 13 years in the NBA thinking I had to be some kind of basketball genius to lead. Truth is, I was never the most talented guy on the court. Hell, I wasn't even close. But what I could do was create space - literally and figuratively - for better players to do what they do best.

Same thing happened in Miami with LeBron and D-Wade. My job wasn't to outshine them. (Good thing, because that wasn't happening.) My job was to give them room to be great. Set screens. Take charges. Handle the dirty work so they could focus on being superstars.

Leadership isn't about having answers. It's about asking better questions.

**When Not Knowing Becomes Your Superpower**

The funny thing about admitting you don't know everything? It makes everyone around you smarter.

I learned this the hard way during my rookie year. Trying to prove I belonged, acting like I understood every play call, every defensive scheme. (I didn't.) Finally, an older player pulled me aside and said, "Rook, stop pretending. Ask questions. We'd rather teach you than watch you fail."

Best advice I ever got.

When my daughter was working through that math problem, I could have jumped in. Could have tried to remember some formula from 30 years ago. (Spoiler alert: wouldn't have worked.) Instead, I just sat there and let her think out loud. Created space for her brain to work.

That's leadership. Not the highlight reel moments. The quiet moments where you step back and let other people shine.

**The Space Between Knowing and Doing**

Here's what I've figured out about leadership after all these years: it's not about being the smartest person in the room. It's about making the room smarter.

Great leaders ask questions that unlock thinking. They create psychological safety where people can be honest about what they don't know. They're comfortable with silence while someone works through a problem.

Most of all, they understand that their job isn't to have all the answers. Their job is to help other people find them.

This applies everywhere. In business. In parenting. In life.

The best coaches I played for weren't the ones who micromanaged every possession. They were the ones who taught principles, created systems, and then trusted us to figure it out on the court. They gave us frameworks, not scripts.

**The Courage to Not Know**

Look, admitting you don't have all the answers takes guts. Especially when people are looking to you for direction. (Been there, trust me.)

But here's the thing: people don't need you to be perfect. They need you to be real. They need space to think, to contribute, to feel like their voice matters.

Some of the best leadership moments I've witnessed happened when someone said, "I don't know. What do you think?"

That question changes everything. It shifts the dynamic from "I'm going to tell you what to do" to "We're going to figure this out together." Game changer.

**Creating Space for Answers to Emerge**

So how do you actually do this? How do you lead without having all the answers?

Start with better questions. Instead of "Here's what we're going to do," try "What do you think our options are?" Instead of solving problems for people, help them think through solutions.

Listen more than you talk. (Revolutionary concept, I know.) Give people room to process, to work through their thinking out loud.

Be comfortable with not knowing. Your uncertainty isn't weakness - it's honesty. And honesty builds trust faster than false confidence ever will.

Most importantly, remember that your job as a leader isn't to be the smartest person in the room. Your job is to make everyone else feel smart enough to contribute their best thinking.

That's how great teams work. That's how great families work. That's how great anything works.

Watching my daughter solve that math problem reminded me of something I'd forgotten: sometimes the best thing you can do is get out of the way and let people figure things out for themselves.

That's not passive leadership. That's the hardest kind of leadership there is.

And maybe, just maybe, it's the kind we need more of.

**Professional Angle**: Career/leadership focus

Had a leadership breakthrough yesterday, and it came from the most unexpected place: watching my daughter struggle with algebra.

She's getting frustrated with a math problem, and I'm sitting there thinking I should help. (Problem: I barely passed algebra myself.) But instead of jumping in with solutions I didn't have, I just... waited.

She started thinking out loud, working through the problem step by step. And suddenly, the answer became clear. To her. She figured it out herself.

This got me thinking about leadership in a completely different way.

**The Leadership Trap**

Most of us think great leaders have all the answers. We feel pressure to be the smartest person in the room, to solve every problem, to never show uncertainty. I spent 13 years in the NBA thinking I needed to be some basketball genius to lead effectively.

Truth is, I was never the most talented player on the court. But what I could do was create space - both literally and figuratively - for better players to excel.

**Space Over Solutions**

The best leaders I played with didn't micromanage every possession. They established frameworks, taught principles, and then trusted the team to execute. They asked better questions instead of providing all the answers.

In business, this translates to:
• Asking "What do you think our options are?" instead of dictating solutions
• Creating psychological safety where uncertainty is okay
• Listening more than talking
• Being comfortable with not knowing everything

**The Power of "I Don't Know"**

Some of the most powerful leadership moments I've witnessed started with someone saying, "I don't know. What do you think?"

That question shifts the entire dynamic. It moves from "I'm going to tell you what to do" to "We're going to figure this out together."

**Your Role as a Leader**

Your job isn't to be the smartest person in the room. Your job is to make everyone else feel smart enough to contribute their best thinking.

Create space for answers to emerge. Trust your team's ability to solve problems. Be comfortable with uncertainty.

Sometimes the best thing you can do as a leader is get out of the way and let people figure things out for themselves.

That's not passive leadership. That's the hardest - and most effective - kind there is.

What's one way you can create more space for your team to contribute their best thinking?

Yesterday I learned a leadership lesson from my daughter's math homework. 📚

She's stuck on a problem, getting frustrated, and I'm sitting there like I can help. (Plot twist: I barely passed algebra.)

But instead of jumping in with solutions I didn't have, I just watched. She started thinking out loud, working through it step by step. And boom - she figured it out herself.

Made me realize: the best leaders aren't the ones with all the answers. They're the ones who create space for answers to emerge.

Spent 13 years in the NBA thinking I needed to be the smartest guy on the court. Truth? I wasn't even close. But I could create space for LeBron and D-Wade to be great.

Same principle applies everywhere. At work. At home. In life.

Your job as a leader isn't to have all the answers. It's to help other people find them.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is get out of the way. 🏀

Had this moment yesterday that completely changed how I think about leadership.

My daughter's working on algebra (something I barely passed myself), getting frustrated with a problem. I'm sitting there feeling pretty useless, like I should be helping but having absolutely no clue what to do.

Then she starts thinking out loud. Just... talking through the problem. Working through each step, explaining what she's trying to do. And suddenly, the answer becomes clear. To her. She figured it out herself.

Made me realize something: maybe the best leaders aren't the ones with all the answers, but the ones who create space for answers to emerge.

This applies everywhere. In business. In parenting. In life.

Your job as a leader isn't to be the smartest person in the room. It's to make everyone else feel smart enough to contribute their best thinking.

Just wrote about this and why admitting "I don't know" might be your leadership superpower.

What do you think? Ever had a moment where stepping back led to better results?
