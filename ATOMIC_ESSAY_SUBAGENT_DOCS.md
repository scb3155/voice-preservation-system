## üíª Usage Examples

### Example 1: Personal Story
```
/atomic-essay "Was talking to my kid about failure yesterday. She was upset about not making the team, and I found myself telling her the same BS about 'everything happens for a reason.' Then I stopped and told her the truth - sometimes things just suck, and that's okay. Made me think about how we sanitize struggle instead of honoring it."
```

### Example 2: Business Insight
```
/atomic-essay "Had this realization in a meeting today. Everyone was trying to sound smart with big words and complex frameworks. But the best idea came from the newest person who just asked a simple question. Reminded me that intelligence isn't about sounding impressive - it's about clarity."
```

### Example 3: Sports Connection
```
/atomic-essay "Watching my daughter's basketball practice reminded me of something Coach K used to say about fundamentals. The flashy stuff gets attention, but games are won with basics done consistently. Same with business, same with life. Boring wins."
```
