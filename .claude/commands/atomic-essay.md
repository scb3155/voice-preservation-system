# Atomic Essay Voice Preservation Command

Transform raw content into a complete multi-platform publishing package while preserving Shane Battier's authentic voice patterns from his GitHub repository.

## Command Execution

I need to delegate this task to the `atomic-essay` subagent, which specializes in Shane Battier's voice preservation system. This subagent will:

1. **Load Shane's Voice Patterns**: Access the GitHub repository at https://github.com/scb3155/shane-writing-system/tree/main/shane-voice-preservation to extract authentic voice patterns
2. **Analyze Raw Content**: Process the provided content to identify core messages, emotional beats, and existing voice elements
3. **Generate Complete Package**: Create optimized content for all platforms while maintaining 90%+ voice authenticity
4. **Validate Authenticity**: Compare all outputs against Shane's reference files to ensure voice consistency

## Raw Content to Process

$ARGUMENTS

## Expected Output

The atomic-essay subagent will deliver a complete content package including:

- **Substack Blog Post** (800-1200 words, enhanced 1/3/1 structure)
- **Twitter Thread** (5-7 tweets, engagement-optimized)
- **LinkedIn Post** (300-400 words, professional angle)
- **Instagram Caption** (150-200 words, visual storytelling)
- **Substack Notes** (200-250 words, traffic driver)

Each piece will maintain Shane's authentic voice patterns including:
- Conversational storyteller tone
- Self-deprecating humor patterns
- Vulnerable but tough emotional range
- Simple problem-solver language (under 18 words/sentence)
- Natural profanity when appropriate
- Sports language and metaphors
- Parenthetical thoughts: "(barely)", "(honestly)"
- Raw emotional honesty levels

All content will be validated against Shane's GitHub voice reference files with authenticity scores provided for transparency.
