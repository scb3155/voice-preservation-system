Raw Sample - Shane's Authentic Voice:

A few examples of different things from my book. When I think of contextual intelligence or reading the room, I'll never forget. My junior year, we lost our first two games against. UConn and Stanford. We were starting three freshmen, and the game was in Madison Square Garden. The moment was just too big, and we lost our first two games. I'll never forget, we were in the shower, and our talented point guard Jason Williams (who went on to become one of the great players who ever played Duke at New Jersey Retired National Player of the Year) was cracking up in the shower. Here we are, Nate James and I, just looking like our dog just died, we lost two in a row like the unimaginable at Duke University. We had to say, "What the f*ck man? We're acting like this doesn't matter, and I mean, we let him have it in the shower right then and there. I promise you after a loss, there was no one on that team who ever cracked a joke or even smiled or even looked too funny. It was an expectation of our group that this really means something, and that we take winning and losing very seriously around here. That only comes from going into situations and being able to read your teammates and read the room to say, "Okay, this is the appropriate way to act in good times and in bad." Because it saves a lot of stress and saves a lot of difficult conversations for later. I've been on teams where winning wasn't really valued. After a game, you couldn't in the shower you couldn't tell if it was a win or a loss. And that is often the difference between championship teams and teams who are just playing up the string.
