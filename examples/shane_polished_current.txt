# Read the Room Like a Champion

Our point guard was cracking jokes in the shower after back-to-back losses at Madison Square Garden.

My junior year at Duke, we opened the season with losses to UConn and Stanford. We were starting three freshmen, and the bright lights of MSG hit us hard. After the second game, I was in the shower with Nate James, feeling like we'd wasted everything we'd built.

Jason Williams our talented, fearless, future National Player of the Year........was laughing about something.

We couldn't believe it.

Two straight losses? At Duke? It's not just about the record. It's about what the losses mean to the guys next to you.

Nate and I looked at him and said:

"What the f***, man?"

That moment flipped a switch. From then on, you didn't see smiles after losses. No jokes. No casual exits.

You could feel the difference because attitude finally matched intention.

## If You Want to Win, You Have to See What Others Don't

Talent doesn't guarantee cohesion.

Great teams rely on trust. A trust that your teammates bring the right presence consistently. That starts with being able to read the situation before reacting.

You can't afford clueless moments.

I've played on teams where the post-game routine never changed. Win or lose, energy stayed flat. That quiet indifference doesn't show up on film, but it corrodes belief like rust.

Elite teams develop an internal radar.

Pay attention, adjust quickly, and match the tone.

## Championship Habits Come from Servant Teammates

Leadership doesn't always raise its voice.

Sometimes, it holds the room steady. That moment with Jason wasn't about blame. It was about clarity.

You set tone by example, especially in moments that feel small.

Want to spark better performance? Use your awareness. Treat your next huddle like it matters. Especially when morale feels fragile.

*In business, it's the same. I've seen high-performing sales teams fall apart over a tone-deaf comment after missed targets. Culture leaks through the cracks you ignore.*

## Not Every Day Feels Like a Win

After certain games, I questioned if I had anything left to give.

When no one around you feels the same, it gets lonely fast.

But we always had one thing.......accountability. We leaned into that when confidence wavered. Leaders helped us pick our heads up, quietly.

You bounce back by anchoring to purpose.

Let self-awareness guide you, not self-pity.

## You Can Be the Shift

Look around.

What does the team need that nobody's saying?

Show that. Be that.

Set your bar higher than convenience. Set it at commitment.
