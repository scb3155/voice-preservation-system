# Shane's 1/3/1 Format for ALL Content

## Core 1/3/1 Writing Rhythm Structure

**Pattern: 1 sentence → 3 sentences → 1 sentence**

1. **Single sentence opener** - Hook the reader with one compelling sentence
2. **Three-sentence expansion** - Explain, tell a story, give description they can hold onto
3. **Single sentence conclusion** - Wrap up the thought cleanly

## Platform-Specific Applications

### Blog Posts & Long-Form
- Use full 1/3/1 with subheads
- Pattern: Subhead → 1/3/1 → Subhead → 1/3/1
- Multiple rhythms throughout (1/4/1, 1/5/1 variations)

### LinkedIn Posts
- 1 sentence opener
- 3 sentences expansion (or 3 short paragraphs)
- 1 sentence conclusion
- Keep Shane's professional but conversational tone

### X (Twitter) Posts
- 1 sentence opener
- 3 bullet points (instead of full sentences)
- 1 sentence conclusion
- Adapt to character limits while maintaining rhythm

### Instagram Posts
- 1 compelling sentence opener
- 3 sentences or short paragraphs for expansion
- 1 strong conclusion sentence
- Include Shane's authentic voice and storytelling

### Atomic Essays
- Limit to 1-2 complete 1/3/1 sequences
- Maintain structure within space constraints

## Key Principles
- Creates "fast and slow" rhythm readers love
- Reader won't notice pattern but will think "this flows!"
- Most effective: single sentence → crescendo → back to single sentence
- Subheads don't count as the opening "1"

## Integration with Voice Preservation System
1. **Agents 1 & 2**: Preserve Shane's authentic voice completely
2. **Agent 3**: Apply 1/3/1 structure for specified platform while maintaining voice
3. **Agent 4**: Final check that both rhythm AND authenticity are intact
