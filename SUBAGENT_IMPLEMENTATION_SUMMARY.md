### Shane's Voice Elements Preserved

‚úÖ Parenthetical thoughts: "(barely)", "(honestly)"
‚úÖ Raw emotional honesty levels

## üìã 1/3/1 Structure Implementation

The subagent applies Shane's preferred structure across all platforms:

### 1 - Hook (Compelling Opener)
- Sets emotional or intellectual stakes
- Uses Shane's authentic opening styles from voice files
- Personal vulnerability or relatable experience

### 3 - Body Sections
1. **Personal Story/Experience**: Vulnerability with Shane's storytelling rhythm
2. **Insight/Lesson Learned**: Conversational analysis with emotional honesty
3. **Broader Application**: Personal-to-universal connection style

### 1 - Conclusion (Powerful Element)
- Strong takeaway using Shane's ending patterns
- Call to reflection in authentic voice
- Vulnerability without weakness balance

## üéØ Voice Authenticity System

### Scoring Criteria
- **95-100%**: Perfect match to reference patterns
- **85-94%**: Good match, minor adjustments suggested
- **70-84%**: Recognizable as Shane but needs refinement
- **Below 70%**: Major revision required

### Validation Process
1. Load voice patterns from GitHub repository or local files
2. Compare all content against authentic samples
